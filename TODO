This is the list of things I'm planning to work on in future versions...

- Implement a fan control algorithm which works better than the one
  the EC uses.
    - Allow configuration of the temperature when the fan turns on and off.
    - Include two configurable speeds.  (e.g. quiet mode and fast mode)
    - Need to determine how much cooling the fan produces at each speed.

- Make the FSB switching smarter:
    - Replace N/M/Voltage values with a single FSB speed value.
    - Automatically pause at intermediate FSB speeds when jumping from
      e.g. 70 to 100 or vice-versa.
    - Configurable voltage threshold (FSB speed at which voltage should
      be raised)

- Integrate with the cpufreq subsystem:
    - Allow on-demand speed changes (so that when CPU load increases, the
      FSB can automatically be raised).
    - This will let the speed be changed using the standard GNOME CPU applet,
      for instance.

- Investigate how the battery stuff works.  I think there's a way to get at
  the battery's remaining capacity in mAh, which would work MUCH better than
  Asus's current (lousy) implementation.  I also think there's a way to find
  out the current power consumption in mAh.

- Find a way to disable the (rather annoying) flashing power LED whilst in
  suspend-to-RAM.

- Investigate ways to decrease power consumption during suspend-to-RAM.
