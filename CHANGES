    - modules init and exit code restyling
    - added writable parameter safer per default

03 Feb 2008 // Version 0.2.2

    - everything in module dir has been moved in its parent
    - module name and version as been uniformed everywhere 
    - dependence from i2c_i801 module print warning
    - modules reinitialize if needed 

29 Jan 2008 // Version 0.2.1

    - eee.c renamed asus_eee.c like asus_acpi.ko, version updated to 0.2.1
    - asus_eee.ko to be install in acpi/ depending asus_acpi.ko
    - Makefile restyled and added patch, reverse_patch and install targets
    - 2.6.21.4-eeepc no i2c_smbus_read_block_data patch application

15 Jan 2008 // Version 0.2
    - Uses the kernel's built-in i2c functions, so it can coexist with the
      i2c_i801 module.
    - Communicates with the embedded controller using its indexed IO port,
      which is much faster than using ACPI.
    - Correctly identified the "mystery" embedded controller parameter as
      controlling the CPU voltage.
    - Reading the /proc/eee/fsb file now shows the current voltage.
    - Added support for monitoring fan speed and CPU temperature.
    - Added support for controlling the fan speed.

29 Nov 2007 // Version 0.1
    - Initial release!
    - Uses ACPI to communicate with the PLL chip and the embedded controller.
