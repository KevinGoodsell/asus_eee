15 Jan 2007 // Version 0.2
    - Uses the kernel's built-in i2c functions, so it can coexist with the
      i2c_i801 module.
    - Communicates with the embedded controller using its indexed IO port,
      which is much faster than using ACPI.
    - Correctly identified the "mystery" embedded controller parameter as
      controlling the CPU voltage.
    - Reading the /proc/eee/fsb file now shows the current voltage.
    - Added support for monitoring fan speed and CPU temperature.
    - Added support for controlling the fan speed.

29 Nov 2007 // Version 0.1
    - Initial release!
    - Uses ACPI to communicate with the PLL chip and the embedded controller.
